# Dota Underlords Build Creator

**1. What will the application do?**

Dota Underlords is a strategic, auto battler game, where players build teams with Alliances to defeat opponents. These
Alliances give a boost to the team depending on how many units have those Alliances. With this project, I will try to 
implement all the different heroes and Alliances, which will allow the user to create teams that can be used during
their games.

**2. Who will use it?**

This application is aimed towards giving Dota Underlords enthusiasts and novices a chance to practice and test out 
different builds, which can be applied to their normal and ranked games.

**3. Why is this project of interest to you?**

Dota Underlords was first introduced to the Dota community as an arcade game under the title *Dota Auto Chess*. 
After its success as an arcade game, Valve decided to create a standalone game *Dota Underlords*. As an avid Dota 2
and Dota Auto Chess player, I have been constantly playing Dota Underlords ever since its release. This project will
allow me to test out different team combinations and its viability in ranked games. In the long run, this project will
enable me to practice using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques and creating a Graphical User Interface
(GUI).
